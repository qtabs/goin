This is a provisional repository for the GRU-COIN project. All code is provisional and unguaranteed.

## Installation

Clone and setup in one command:
```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd goin
./setup.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd goin
cd .. && git clone https://github.com/qtabs/COIN_Python.git && cd goin
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contents
coin.py : Generative model for the [COIN model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04129-3)
	Provides for three main classes:
		GenerativeModel() : Base class 
		ExplicitGenerativeModel(GenerativeModel) : Generative model that generates data by first sampling the transition probability matrices for context and cue transitions using GEM and DP. This construction is an approximation, since the transisition probability matrices should have infinite dimension.
		CRFGenerativeModel(GenerativeModel) : Generative model that generates data using the Chinese Restaurant Franchise constructions. This construction is exact.
		Cue emissions should work in principle in both versions but they have not been tested.
	In addition it provides for secondary functions that can be used to benchmark and interact with the COIN inference model. This requires the inference part of the COIN, available [here](https://github.com/jamesheald/COIN)

goin.py : Set of classes and functions that fit GRU-RNNs to predict data sampled from the COIN generative model.
	Provides for two classes:
		GruRNN(torch.nn.Module): Pytorch-specified recurrent neural network with the input and output linear layers necessary to perform inference over samples of the COIN Generative Model.
		Model(): General and extensible class to fit pytorch modules to the COIN Generative Model. Assumes that the output of the pytorch module encodes the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution.
	In addition it provides for secondary functions that can be used to perform group fits and compare the performance with the COIN inference model.

noin.py: a clone of goin.py handling mixture of Gaussian predictive distributions.
